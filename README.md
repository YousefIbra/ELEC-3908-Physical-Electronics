# ELEC-3908

Course objectives:

Engineers working with microprocessors and microcontrollers (including mobile devices)
must understand computer systems at this level, and these concepts form the
foundation on which more powerful computer systems are based (such as desktop
systems, servers, multiprocessors, and supercomputers). Therefore, this course
introduces students to basic computer organization and functional design down to the
gate-level abstraction, and to hardware/software interfacing.

List of topics:

• Computer system architecture:

    o Computer system components: processor, memory, I/O, interconnection bus
    o Information encoding, data representation in binary, hexadecimal
    o Number systems, unsigned integers, signed integers, 2’s complement, 
      floating point
    o Computer hardware organization: datapath and control
    o Registers, instruction cycle
    
• Hardware/software interface:

    o Instructions: data manipulation, data transfer, control flow, instruction   
      encoding
    o Computer arithmetic, flags
    
• Microcontroller example:

    o Microcontroller concept
    o System on Chip, memory model, ISA
    
• Assembly language programming:

    o Code snippets, examples
    o Assembly process, linker, loader
    
• High‐level Language Support:

    o Variables, arrays, structures, assignment, looping, conditional statements
    o Procedures and functions, parameter passing
    
• Peripheral I/O and Interrupts:

    o Register model of peripheral devices: parallel I/O, serial I/O, timers
    o Polling
    o Hardware interrupts: vectored and prioritized, Nested Vector Interrupt
      Controller(NVIC)
    o Examples: timer, serial
    o Software interrupts, O/S calls
